# NeetCode 150 – Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to the **NeetCode 150** problems, a curated list of the most important Data Structures and Algorithms questions commonly asked in technical interviews.

The goal of this repo is to:

* Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
* Learn and recognize common DSA patterns
* Maintain clean, well-documented solutions for revision

## 📌 What is NeetCode 150?

NeetCode 150 is a structured list of 150 LeetCode problems grouped by patterns such as Arrays, Sliding Window, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more. It is widely used for interview preparation at companies like FAANG and top startups.

---

## 🧠 How I’m Using This Repo

* Problems are organized **by pattern**, not difficulty
* Each solution includes:

  * Problem description (brief)
  * Approach
  * Time and space complexity
  * Focus is on **clarity and correctness**, not just passing test cases
